# Create a basic app with yarn

After trying several times to create a basic react app, I gave up and surrendered to yarn create for my applications

## Basic steps
Let’s prepare the environment:
[install yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
```sh
$  npm install -g yarn
```
After install yarn global, we gonna use [yarn create](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/create/) to bring create-react-app with yarn 

```sh
$  yarn create react-app my-app
$  cd my-app/
$ yarn start
```
